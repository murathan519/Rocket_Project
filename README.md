# Rocket_Project
I participated a rocket team in 2020 during pandemics.
I was the only electronical and software designer of the group. I designed sensor subsystem, circuitry, communication subsytem and software subsystem.
All the subsystems that I'm in charge tested and worked %100 succesfully. However due to physical constraints of pandemics, mechanical integrity and flight never done.

Here is the list of the things that I done:
1) 5000m distance line of sight communication with handmade antennas. I got help from Prof. Dr. Selçuk Paker (İTÜ) in the antenna design.
2) Communication module selection and calibration. I used XBEE RF module.
3) Circuit designs of 3 computers with Altium.
4) Wired communication between primary and backup computers via I2C protocol.
5) Sensor selections and calibrations.
6) Flight software of 3 computers.
